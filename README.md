# 🌀 Odooflow CLI

**Odooflow CLI** is a command-line interface tool designed to streamline the development workflow for Odoo projects. It helps clone Odoo modules (and their dependencies), handles GitLab lookups, and provides options for deep recursive cloning.

## 🚀 Features

- Clone an Odoo module by Git URL
- Recursively resolve and clone all dependencies
- Smart skip of Odoo core modules
- Branch selection for cloning
- Helpful and colorful CLI output
- Built using [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and Python 3.9+

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/odooflow-cli.git
cd odooflow-cli
pip install .
```

Or install directly from source for development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## 🛠️ Usage

Once installed, you can use the CLI by running:

```bash
odooflow clone --url <GIT_REPO_URL> [--branch <BRANCH>] [--deep]
```

### 🔹 Options:

| Flag        | Description                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `--url`     | Full HTTP URL of the module repo         |
| `--branch`  | (Optional) Git branch to clone from      |
| `--deep`    | Recursively clone all dependencies       |

### 🔍 Examples:

Clone a single module:

```bash
odooflow clone --url https://gitlab.com/mygroup/my_odoo_module.git
```

Clone with specific branch:

```bash
odooflow clone --url https://gitlab.com/mygroup/my_odoo_module.git --branch 17.0
```

Clone deeply with dependencies:

```bash
odooflow clone --url https://gitlab.com/mygroup/my_odoo_module.git --deep
```

## WISH-LIST:

Move this CLI into fully-integrated Odoo environment, using Odoo, users can create issues, add the amount of details, then sync these issues with Odooflow.

We can do integration with any code agent to help developers to achieve these issues 

same thing for pipelines, I think it will be amazing if developers can build pipelines using Odoo, then apply the same pipelines using Odooflow.

I have many things in my head, I will back soon to this project.
